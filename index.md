###[An In-depth Guide to OLS Assumptions: Connecting Procedural and Theory](https://medium.com/@christopher.daehyun.kim/an-in-depth-look-into-the-assumptions-of-ols-b7808ba72469)

In this article, I go over the assumptions of OLS that are commonly known. I wanted to provide an indepth examination on the what, where, why, and how of the assumptions with a focus on the linear algebra behind it all. I go over the procedural proofs of the assumptions, and how the assumptions all interconnect.
